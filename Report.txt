(a) Run the code corresponding to Question No. 6 from HW0 for n = 4000
with ‘format flag’ equal to 0 and then equal to 1. Report the sizes in
MB of the two files that are generated (you can use the command ‘du
–sh {filename}’).

Ans:
array00400_asc.out : size on disk = 319 MB (33,55,03,360 bytes)
array00400_bin.out : size on disk = 122 MB (12,80,00,000 bytes)


(b)Estimate the size of the array in memory by multiplying the size of
one double (8 bytes) with the number of doubles (n^2)in the array.
Comment on the size in memory vs size on disk for the above two files.
Comment on which format is best suited for saving large data.


Answer :
---> Estimated size :
 --> size of double 8 bytes
 --> total memory required : n*n *8 bytes = 8×16,000,000=128,000,000 B =122.0703125 MB


 Comments :

 > Binary file(bin) : size on the disk(122.1 MB) matches exactly with Estimated size as it stores the raw data without extra formatting.
 >ASCII file (asc): The size (319.9 MB) is significantly larger because -->
    1.Conversion of binary values to human-readable decimal strings.
    2.Extra characters like spaces and newline characters
    3.Higher precision representation (15 decimal places).

So I can conclude that , it is better to store data in bin file as It requires significantly less space than ASCII and Faster read/write operations as no conversion is needed.
ASCII format (asc) is better when data needs to be human-readable but is inefficient for large datasets due to size and slower performance.
